# Telecommunications-NTUA
Project assignment for the course "Introduction to Telecommuntications" of the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens during Fall Semester 2021.

The project consisted of five parts which are described below.

# Part 1
We were given three signals: a triangular periodic pulse sequence, a sine wave, and a sum of sine waves of different frequencies, and we sampled them at different frequencies.

# Part 2
In this part, we considered the triangular periodic pulse sequence from Part 1 as the input to a mid-riser uniform quantizer and plotted the quantizer's output on a graph. We also calculated the standard deviation of the quantization error as well as the quantization signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Finally, we presented the corresponding transmission flow from bits (bitstream) considering POLAR RZ encoding.

# Part 3
In this part, we generated a random sequence of 36 digits and modulated it using binary phase-shift keying (BPSK), quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK), and 8-PSK. Then, we modulated the bit sequence using binary pulse amplitude modulation (B-PAM) and presented the corresponding constellation diagram. Next, we added additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) to the B-PAM signal and presented the new constellation diagrams that resulted. Finally, we calculated and presented on a diagram the probability of bit error (BER).

# Part 4
In this part, we were given a text file that we quantized, modulated with QPSK, and then added noise. Finally, we reconstructed the text file for two cases: i) E_s/N_0 = 5dB, and ii) E_s/N_0 = 15dB.

# Part 5
In this part, we repeated Part 4 but this time for an audio file.
